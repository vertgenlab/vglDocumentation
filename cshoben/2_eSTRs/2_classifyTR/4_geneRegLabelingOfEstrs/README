all these scripts need their awk corrected for the OFS and FS. Also, this was filtering on a value that was not the caviar score. Not something we are moving forward with so deleting output files, they can be recreated.

Note that the gonomics program has since been re-written and the name has changed to 'bedMinimumDistanceName.go'. Will need to rewrite scripts to accomodate new functionality.
