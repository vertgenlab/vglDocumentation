Notes on how some files were made:
cp WholeBloodFRCollapseDNA.txt totalEstrStudied.txt

collapseEdited... was made by manually adding repeats like GTTGTT. Originally, although later decided against, this file was edited to allow for a crude comparision between the HipSTR reference and the eSTR data. The eSTR data did not have its repeats simplified so GTT could be GTTGTT and also GTTGTTGTT etc.
