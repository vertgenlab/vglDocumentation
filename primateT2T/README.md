These files were used to generate Figures 5A/B from "Complete Sequencing of Ape Genomes", as submitted to BioRxiv.

A few notes on required software:
1. Scripts will reference a directory for the kentUtils package (/hpc/group/vertgenlab/cl454/bin/x86_64/ on our cluster).
To replicate these findings, simply replace this path with a local kentUtils installation.
2. Similarly, these programs assume a local installation of Gonomics in the ~/go/bin/ directory, and a bedtools installation on the path.

Please reach out to one of us (rimangan@mit.edu, yanting.luo@duke.edu, or craig.lowe@duke.edu) for any and all questions.

Thanks!
