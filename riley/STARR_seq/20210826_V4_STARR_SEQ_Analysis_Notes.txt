PART 1: Input Library Sequencing Analysis

1. bcl2fastq
	a. As the STARR-seq input was the only library on this lane, I hid the samplesheet by renaming it SampleSheet.csv.hidden.
	b. I generated fastqs with the illumina bcl2fastq cmd, which can be loaded as a module on DCC. sbatch --mem=64G --wrap="bcl2fastq --use-bases-mask Y28,I8n2,n10,Y90 --create-fastq-for-index-reads"
2. Next I aligned to the custom reference with the following shell script:
	 /hpc/group/vertgenlab/riley/STARR_SEQ_ANALYSIS/V4/alignV4_Input.csh
3. The number of reads aligning to each construct was then ascertained with the following script, located in the same directory: getRawCounts.csh.

PART 2: Output Library Reporter Pooled UMI Counts

1. bcl2fastq in the following directory:
	/hpc/group/vertgenlab/LabDataSets/20210823_NovaSeq_V4_STARR_Seq/210820_A00201R_0482_AHJJ3NDRXY
	Demultiplexing used the sample sheet located in that directory. 
	Base mask as follows: Y28,I8n2,n10,Y90
2. Next aligned all reads to the custom reference using the following script: /hpc/group/vertgenlab/riley/STARR_SEQ_ANALYSIS/V4/alignV4_Output_BWA.csh
3. Next used the getReadNames.csh script, located in the same directory, to pull the names of all fastq entries aligning to reporter constructs.
4. Used fastqFilterReporterReads.csh to generate a fastq file for each lane and library containing only reads that mapped to reporter constructs.
5. Next script is /hpc/group/vertgenlab/riley/STARR_SEQ_ANALYSIS/V4/NamesFilteredFastq/mergeFastqLanes.csh, which combines the reporter reads from the two sequencing lanes so that we can collapse UMIs that appeared on separate lanes.
6. Next we collapse UMIs using the script collapseUMIsFromMerged.csh. Output is directed to the dir Collapse/.
7. In Collapse, run the script runBwa.csh to generate rawUmi sam files.
8. Once the sam files are generated, use getRawUmiCounts.csh to generate the umi counts.
9. Download the raw UMI counts from the output reporter reads along with the counts from the input library and format the data in microsoft excel.
