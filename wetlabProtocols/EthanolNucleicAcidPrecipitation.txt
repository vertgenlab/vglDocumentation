Ethanol Precipitation of Nucleic Acids
Lowe Lab Standard Operating Procedure
Prepared by Riley J. Mangan

Protocol
1. Add 1/10 volume of 3M na-Acetate pH 5.2, and 2 to 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol to the DNA sample.
2. Mix and store at -20C for at least 1 hour to precipitate the DNA.
3. Recover the precipitated DNA by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 15-20 minutes.
4. Pour off the ethanol and wash the pellet twice with room-temperature 70% ethanol.
5. Allow the DNA pellet to air-dry.
6. Resuspend the DNA in a suitable volume of sterile TE buffer or distilled water.
