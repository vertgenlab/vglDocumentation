FACS Prep Protocol from Fernando(Silver Lab)

This protocol is for embryonic mouse brains from E15.5 to E17.5.

If using directly for RNA: sort cells directly in 350-500 uL RLT buffer with B-Mercaptoethanol (10 uL/1 mL of buffer), depending on the number of cells to be sorted. Typically, 1 million of sorted cell add 1 mL of volume to the collection tube. After sorting, the tubes should immediated be frozen at -80C.

1. Dissect in ice-cold PBS (without magnesium or calcium to minimize clumping).
2. Dissect out cortices, removing meninges. Cortices grabbed with sterile cut pipette p1000 tip, taking care to suck up as little liquid as possible with cortices (or grab carefully with tweezers).
3. Remove PBS and place the cortex (or 2 cortices at a time if needed) in 250 uL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA supplemented with 1/1000 DNAse I*.
4. Put at 37C for 10 minutes.
5. Remove trypsin and add 1 mL ice-cold 10% FBS/HBSS/Propidium iodide (12.5 uL/10 mL)**/DNAse I (1/1000). [FOR RED FLUORESCENCE USE DAPI (5 ug/mL) INSTEAD OF PROPIDIUM IODIDE] FBS will inactivate trypsin.
6. Gently titrate 10 times with small bore fire-polished glass pipette or p1000 pipette.
7. Put cells through 30 um cell strainer into sorting tubes.
8. Keep on ice.
9. Ready to sort.
