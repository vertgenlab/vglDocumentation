Near-IR LIVE/DEAD Staining Protocol
Dye Preparation

1. Bring one vial of the fluorescent reactive dye (component A) and the vial of anhydrous DMSO (component B) to room temperature before removing the caps.
2. Add 50 uL of DMSO to the vial of reactive dye. Mix well and visually confirm that all of the dye has dissolved.
3. Use the solution of reactive dye as soon as possible, ideally within a few hours. Unused protions may be used for up to 2 weeks if stored at or below -20C, protected from light and moisture.

Cell Staining

Buffers appropriate for cell staining include phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), and Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS), without extraneous proteins such as bovine serum albumin or serum. 

1. Centrifuge a sample of cells in suspension containing at least 1x10^6 cells. Discard the supernatant.
2. Wash the cells once with 1 mL of PBS.
3. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS.
4. Count the cells and adjust the density with PBS to 1x10^6 cells in a 1 mL volume.
5. Add 1 uL of the reconstituted fluorescent reactive dye to 1 mL of the cell suspension and mix well.
6. Incubate at romm temperature or on ice for 30 minutes, PROTECTED FROM LIGHT.
7. Wash the cells twice with 1 mL of PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin.
8. Resuspend in 1 mL of PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin.
11. Analyze the cell suspension by flow cytometry using the appropriate excitation and detection channel. For Near-IR fluorescent reactive dye: 633/635 nm excitation, ~780 nm detection.
